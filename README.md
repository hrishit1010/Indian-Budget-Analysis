# Indian-Budget-Analysis
# Indian Economic and Union Budget Analysis Project

## 📖 About This Project

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of India's economic indicators and Union Budget allocations. It is divided into three main components:

1.  **National-Level Economic Forecasting:** Using data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), this component models and predicts key national metrics like population, GDP, HDI, and life expectancy using linear regression.
2.  **State-Level Economic Analysis:** This part dives into state-specific economic data from 1990-2022, analyzing Per Capita Income, Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), Net State Domestic Product (NSDP), and tax revenues to identify regional trends and disparities.
3.  **Union Budget Allocation Analysis:** This component examines Indian Union Budget data, breaking down allocations by both ministry and state. It identifies spending trends over the last decade and uses linear regression to forecast future ministry-wise budgets.

## 📊 Key Analyses & Visualizations

This project performs detailed data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to uncover insights.

### 1. National-Level Economic Analysis (IMF Dataset)

* **Model:** Linear Regression
* **Predictions:**
    * Year vs. Population
    * Year vs. GDP Per Capita
    * Year vs. Human Development Index (HDI)
    * Year vs. Life Expectancy (Overall, Male, and Female)
* **Visualizations:**
    * Regression plots for all predicted metrics.
    * Correlation heatmap of all IMF economic indicators.
    * Scatter plots for `GDP vs. HDI` and `GDP vs. Life Expectancy`.

### 2. State-Level Economic Analysis (State Indicators Dataset)

* **Analysis:** Examination of state-level economic indicators from 1990 to 2022.
* **Visualizations:**
    * **Per Capita Income Trend (1990-2022):** Line plot showing the growth of per capita income for all states.
    * **Per Capita Income (2022):** Sunburst chart illustrating the contribution of each state to the national per capita income.
    * **Tax Revenue (2021):** Treemap showing the share of tax revenue generated by each state.
    * **GSDP (2020):** Bar chart comparing the Gross State Domestic Product of all states.
    * **Sectoral Contribution:** Bar chart showing the mean value added by different sectors (Services, Industry, Agriculture, etc.).
    * **NSDP Trends:** Grouped bar charts and line plots comparing Net State Domestic Product for top states in 1990, 2000, and 2022.
    * **NSDP Heatmap:** A heatmap visualizing the NSDP values across states and years.

### 3. Union Budget Allocation Analysis (State & Ministry Datasets)

* **Analysis:** Comparative analysis of budget allocations for states and ministries between 2013-14 and 2024-25.
* **Visualizations:**
    * **State Allocations:**
        * Line graph of budget trends for the top 5 and bottom 5 states.
        * Bar graph comparing budget allocations for all states in 2024-25.
        * Pie charts showing the share of total budget allocation by state for 2013-14 vs. 2024-25.
    * **Ministry Allocations:**
        * Line graph of budget allocation trends over time for key ministries.
        * Bar chart comparing allocations for key ministries in 2024-25.
        * Grouped bar chart comparing 2013-14 and 2024-25 budgets by ministry.
        * Correlation heatmaps for budget allocations across different years and ministries.
    * **Forecasting:**
        * Linear regression plots predicting future budget allocations for specific ministries (e.g., Defence, Education, Health).

## 🗂️ Datasets Used

* **IMF Dataset (`imf.csv`):** Contains national-level data for India from 1980, including Population, Inflation, GDP, HDI, and Life Expectancy.
* **State Economic Data (`india.csv`):** Contains state-wise data from 1990-2022, including Per Capita Income, GSDP, NSDP, and Tax Revenue.
* **State-wise Budget (`state.xlsx`):** Contains state-wise budget allocation data for the financial years 2013-14 and 2024-25.
* **Ministry-wise Budget (`ministries_budget.xlsx`):** Contains budget allocation data for all union ministries from 2013-14 to 2024-25.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack & Methodology

* **Languages & Tools:** Python, Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook
* **Libraries:**
    * `Pandas`: For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
    * `NumPy`: For numerical operations.
    * `Matplotlib`: For creating static plots.
    * `Seaborn`: For advanced statistical visualizations (heatmaps, bar plots).
    * `Plotly Express`: For creating interactive visualizations (sunburst charts, treemaps).
    * `Scikit-learn (sklearn)`: For implementing Linear Regression models and evaluating metrics.
* **Data Preprocessing:**
    * **Cleaning:** Handled missing values (NaN) by dropping rows, filling with `0`, or using forward-fill (`ffill`).
    * **Transformation:** Converted data to numeric types, set appropriate headers, and applied normalization (Min-Max and Z-Score) where needed.
